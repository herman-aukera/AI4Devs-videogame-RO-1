# Cross-Game Tournament System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Cross-Game Tournament System is a comprehensive feature that connects all 10 existing AI4Devs retro games into competitive tournaments. This system will allow players to compete across multiple games in structured tournaments while maintaining the authentic retro arcade experience. The system must integrate seamlessly with existing games without requiring code modifications, following the established "no overengineering" principle from DEVELOPMENT.md.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Tournament Management Core

**User Story:** As a retro gaming enthusiast, I want to create and manage tournaments across multiple games, so that I can compete in structured competitions that span the entire game collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the tournament interface THEN the system SHALL display options to create new tournaments with 3-10 game selections
2. WHEN I create a tournament THEN the system SHALL validate game availability and save tournament configuration to LocalStorage
3. WHEN I configure tournament settings THEN the system SHALL support both single-elimination and round-robin formats
4. IF LocalStorage exceeds 5MB THEN the system SHALL implement data compression and cleanup procedures
5. WHEN a tournament is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique tournament ID and initialize participant tracking

### Requirement 2: Score Integration and Normalization

**User Story:** As a tournament participant, I want my scores from different games to be fairly compared, so that tournaments accurately reflect performance across diverse game types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game completes during a tournament THEN the system SHALL automatically capture the final score via CustomEvents
2. WHEN scores are captured THEN the system SHALL normalize scores across different game types (Snake points vs Tetris lines vs Pac-Man dots)
3. WHEN calculating rankings THEN the system SHALL apply consistent scoring algorithms that account for game difficulty and duration
4. IF a game fails to report scores THEN the system SHALL log the error and provide manual score entry options
5. WHEN tournament scores are updated THEN the system SHALL recalculate leaderboards within 25ms

### Requirement 3: Real-Time Tournament Interface

**User Story:** As a tournament participant, I want to see live tournament progress and standings, so that I can track my performance and know what games remain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing tournament dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current leaderboard with participant rankings and scores
2. WHEN a tournament round completes THEN the system SHALL update the interface within 100ms maintaining 60fps performance
3. WHEN accessing tournament details THEN the system SHALL show remaining games, completed games, and next scheduled matches
4. IF tournament data changes THEN the system SHALL update all connected interfaces using the EventBus pattern
5. WHEN tournament concludes THEN the system SHALL display final results and save tournament history

### Requirement 4: Game Integration Without Modification

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want the tournament system to work with all existing games without changing their code, so that game integrity is preserved and maintenance is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with existing games THEN the system SHALL use only CustomEvents and DOM observation patterns
2. WHEN a game loads THEN the tournament system SHALL automatically detect if it's part of an active tournament
3. WHEN game completion occurs THEN the system SHALL capture scores through event listeners without modifying game logic
4. IF a game doesn't support tournament integration THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and log the limitation
5. WHEN tournament mode is active THEN games SHALL continue to function normally for non-tournament play

### Requirement 5: Mobile and Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a mobile user with accessibility needs, I want to participate in tournaments using touch controls and assistive technologies, so that the tournament experience is inclusive and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing tournaments on mobile THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive with touch-optimized controls (minimum 44px)
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all tournament features SHALL be accessible via keyboard shortcuts
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic markup
4. IF using high contrast mode THEN tournament interfaces SHALL maintain readability with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
5. WHEN tournament text is displayed THEN it SHALL be in Spanish following existing UI patterns ("TORNEO", "CREAR TORNEO", "CLASIFICACIÃ“N")

### Requirement 6: Performance and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want comprehensive testing and performance monitoring, so that tournament functionality remains reliable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tournament system loads THEN it SHALL implement a `runAuditTasks()` method with comprehensive test coverage
2. WHEN tournament operations execute THEN they SHALL complete within performance budgets (creation < 50ms, updates < 10ms)
3. WHEN running quality audits THEN the system SHALL validate integration with all 10 games and report compatibility status
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL log metrics and provide optimization recommendations
5. WHEN tournament data persists THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and handle storage quota exceeded scenarios

### Requirement 7: Retro Aesthetic Integration

**User Story:** As a retro gaming fan, I want the tournament interface to match the authentic 1980s neon aesthetic of the existing games, so that the visual experience remains cohesive and immersive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tournament interfaces render THEN they SHALL use the established neon color palette (#00ffff, #ff00ff, #ffff00, #00ff00)
2. WHEN displaying tournament text THEN the system SHALL use monospace fonts consistent with existing games
3. WHEN showing tournament effects THEN the system SHALL implement neon glow effects and CRT-style aesthetics
4. IF tournament UI elements are added THEN they SHALL follow the existing CSS patterns and design tokens
5. WHEN tournament animations play THEN they SHALL maintain the retro arcade feel with sharp color transitions

### Requirement 8: Tournament History and Analytics

**User Story:** As a competitive player, I want to view my tournament history and performance statistics, so that I can track improvement and compare achievements over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tournaments complete THEN the system SHALL save detailed results including participant performance and game-by-game scores
2. WHEN viewing tournament history THEN the system SHALL display past tournaments with searchable and filterable results
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL calculate statistics like win rates, average scores, and improvement trends
4. IF storage limitations occur THEN the system SHALL implement data archiving with export/import functionality
5. WHEN displaying analytics THEN the system SHALL present data in visually appealing charts using the retro aesthetic
