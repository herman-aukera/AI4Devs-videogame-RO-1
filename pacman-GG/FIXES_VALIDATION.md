# Pac-Man Bug Fixes - TDD Validation Report

## Testing Date: January 20, 2025

### 🎯 **Critical Bug Fixes Applied**

#### ✅ **Bug 1: Ghost Release System**
- **Issue:** Only Blinky was leaving the ghost house
- **Fix Applied:** Corrected release delay logic in `GhostAI.update()`
- **Expected Behavior:** Staggered ghost release (Blinky=0s, Pinky=5s, Inky=10s, Clyde=15s)
- **Validation:** Check console logs for release notifications

#### ✅ **Bug 2: Collision & Life System**  
- **Issue:** Game restarted instead of losing a life
- **Fix Applied:** Removed entity recreation in `playerDeath()`, implemented proper position reset
- **Expected Behavior:** Lives decrease, positions reset, game continues until lives=0
- **Validation:** Collision should show "Player death! Lives remaining: X"

#### ✅ **Bug 3: Movement Flickering**
- **Issue:** Pac-Man and ghosts jumped/flickered between positions
- **Fix Applied:** Fixed interpolation logic in both `PacManPlayer` and `GhostAI` classes
- **Expected Behavior:** Smooth movement between grid positions
- **Validation:** Visual inspection for smooth animations

## 🧪 **Manual Test Checklist**

### Game Start Test
- [ ] Press ENTER to start (not SPACE)
- [ ] Blinky exits immediately  
- [ ] Pinky exits after ~5 seconds
- [ ] Inky exits after ~10 seconds
- [ ] Clyde exits after ~15 seconds
- [ ] Console shows release logs

### Collision Test
- [ ] Let Pac-Man hit a ghost
- [ ] Lives counter decreases by 1
- [ ] Positions reset to start
- [ ] Game continues if lives > 0
- [ ] Game over when lives = 0

### Movement Test  
- [ ] Pac-Man moves smoothly in all directions
- [ ] No flickering during movement
- [ ] Ghosts move smoothly
- [ ] Grid alignment maintained

### AI Behavior Test
- [ ] Ghosts switch between SCATTER and CHASE modes
- [ ] Power pellets activate FLEE mode
- [ ] Vulnerable timer works correctly
- [ ] Ghost personalities exhibit correct behavior

## 🔧 **Technical Changes Made**

### Code Changes
1. **Ghost Release Logic** (`GhostAI.update()` lines 708-719)
   - Fixed conditional check for release delay
   - Added proper house exit logic

2. **Death System** (`playerDeath()` lines 1275-1310)
   - Removed `new PacManPlayer()` entity recreation
   - Implemented position/state reset instead
   - Fixed coordinate system consistency

3. **Movement Interpolation** (`PacManPlayer.update()` and `GhostAI.update()`)
   - Corrected interpolation from current → target position
   - Fixed flickering caused by wrong start/end calculations

### Debugging Enhancements

## � **WORK IN PROGRESS - KNOWN ISSUES**

**⚠️ STATUS: WIP - PARTIAL FUNCTIONALITY**

### Current Issues
- ❌ **Ghost AI Bug:** Only Blinky (red ghost) is functional
- ❌ **Release System:** Pinky, Inky, and Clyde remain stuck in ghost house
- ❌ **State Machine:** Individual ghost timing not working correctly
- ⚠️ **Audio:** Safari fallback implemented but untested

### Working Features
- ✅ **Basic Gameplay:** Pac-Man movement and pellet collection
- ✅ **Blinky AI:** Red ghost follows correct SCATTER/CHASE behavior
- ✅ **Collision Detection:** Player death and scoring functional
- ✅ **Grid System:** Proper 19x21 maze alignment
- ✅ **Controls:** ENTER to start, arrow keys for movement

**Status: 🚧 NEEDS ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT**
