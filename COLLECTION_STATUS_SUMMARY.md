### üèõÔ∏è Established Architectural Patterns

#### Game Engine Foundation
```javascript
class RetroGameEngine {
  // Standardized base class with:
  // - 60fps performance monitoring
  // - TDD audit framework (runAuditTasks)
  // - Mobile touch controls
  // - Audio management
  // - State management (menu, playing, paused, gameOver)
  // - Local storage for high scores
}
```

#### Quality Assurance Framework
- **Comprehensive TDD audits** with critical and non-critical tests
- **Performance benchmarking** with 60fps targets
- **Cross-browser validation** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Mobile compatibility testing** with touch gesture support
